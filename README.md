# ðŸ§© Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## ðŸ“˜ Introduction

This repository is dedicated to exploring the concept of **requirement analysis**, a crucial phase in the software development lifecycle (SDLC).

Requirement analysis focuses on **understanding what the user needs**, defining the **scope of the system**, and identifying **functional and non-functional requirements** before development begins.

The purpose of this repository is to:

- Document key principles and processes in requirement analysis.
- Provide examples of requirement gathering techniques.
- Demonstrate how proper analysis improves software quality and user satisfaction.

Through this project, I aim to highlight how clear and well defined requirements lead to successful and efficient software delivery.
